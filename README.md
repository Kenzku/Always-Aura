This is a part of my Master's thesis work, the topic is **Web Technology on Internet of Things**

## Build the app

To sreve the application you need a server running Node.js with NPM installed. Step to get the web server running:

    cd WAMP-Tryout
    npm install
    node wamp.js

```wamp.js``` itself acts as a webserver and WAMP server.

**The application is still under development** and it does not work yet.
